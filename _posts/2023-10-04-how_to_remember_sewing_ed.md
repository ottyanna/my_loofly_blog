Last year I sew a nice overall and now I would like to sew a new one 
and I'm planning to sew another one in the future. 
I'll record here a log of what I should always remember, maybe one day it will become a serious post on how to do things right or to avoid mistakes. 

I'll put advice based on what I need at the end, so you can skip that.

I'm currently using the pattern and instructions from [Stitched in Wonderland](https://stitchedinwonderland.com/product/the-lazy-day-dungas/).

### How to buy fabric (when it's corduroy)

You should always, and I say always, remember that the lines should be along the height of the garment not horizontal (otherwise they will look awful). So you can estimate the length of the fabric needed using the height from the ground to your shoulders.

> For me the best length is 1.50 m
