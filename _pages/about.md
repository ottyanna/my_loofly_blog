Hello this is me.

I'm Anna and I live in Italy. I'm mastering in Physics at the moment, but I have many interests outside my field. I sew, make traditional and digital art, crochet, code and love to play Dnd, Call of Cthulhu, Arkham Horror and sometimes Flesh and Blood.

I live with two beautiful cats, Angelina and Penelope and I love them very much.
