This tutorial is aimed at those who wish to use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to create [scalable vector graphics](https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) (svg) images to be included in a scientific paper. The following images were the ones I created for my bfâ€™s thesis, so they are not comprehensive, but a good way to start. If you have any request or suggestion, please feel free to comment.......?

## about Inkscape and how to install
Inkscape is a cool free [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) vector graphics software that lets you create vector images. A vector image is a type of computer graphic that uses geometry tools to create shapes in your design, such that if you scale it, it won't become pixellated, as it is not rasterized. It is really useful for publishing anything that needs to be as clear as possible in every format, such as for a logo or an image for your scientific paper.
But as it is simple to understand the concept, it isn't easy to use, because the interface has so many commands. Here I'll show how you can create nice graphics specifically for your scientific research without much trouble.

### Installation
Inkscape supports the main operating systems (Linux, Windows and MacOS) and you can download it [here](https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.3.2/) (please make sure that you click the current stable version). I'll be using the .... version.
